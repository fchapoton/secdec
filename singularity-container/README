The scripts in this directory can be used to set up a Singularity
container with pySecDec dependencies, and use that to run a self-hosted
github test runner.

To use these scripts:

1. Run ./build.sh to build baseimage.sif.

   Note that sudo is used here, but nowhere else.

2. Run ./config.sh to create $TMP/pysecdec-github-runner directory
   with all the needed files set up, and register the runner on
   Github. Note that you'll need to go to Settings->Actions->Self-hosted
   runners->Add runner to get the registration token. Only Github project
   owners can do this.

   Note that ./config.sh can be re-run multiple times, and it will
   recreate and re-register everything anew.

3. You can run ./clear.sh to remove $TMP/pysecdec-github-runner.

4. You can run ./run.sh to run Github Runner in the foreground.

5. You can run ./shell.sh to log into the container (using Bash).

6. You can run ./daemon-start.sh to start ./run.sh in the background
   (as a daemon).

   If you did, then ./daemon-status.sh will print the status of this
   daemon, and ./daemon-stop.sh will try to stop it (by brute force).
