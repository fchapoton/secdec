bubble1L_expansion_by_regions
=============================

The following examples demonstrate the basic usage of expansion by regions within pySecDec.


generate_bubble1L_expansion_by_regions_large_mass
-------------------------------------------------

Computes the large mass expansion. Assumes s << msq, computes up to and including the 2nd order in s.

generate_bubble1L_expansion_by_regions_small_mass
-------------------------------------------------

Computes the small mass expansion. Assumes msq->z\*msq, computes up to and including the 2nd order in z.
