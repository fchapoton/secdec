bubble1L_expansion_by_regions
=============================

The following examples demonstrate the basic use of expansion by regions within pySecDec.

generate_bubble1L_expansion_by_regions_all_z
--------------------------------------------

Assumes all invariants scale like z (technical check).

generate_bubble1L_expansion_by_regions_no_z
-------------------------------------------

Assumes no invariants scale like z (technical check).

generate_bubble1L_expansion_by_regions_large_mass
-------------------------------------------------

Computes the large mass expansion. Assumes s->z\*s, computes up to and including the 2nd order in z.

generate_bubble1L_expansion_by_regions_small_mass
-------------------------------------------------

Computes the small mass expansion. Assumes m->z\*msq, computes up to and including the 5th order in z. Note that due to the high expansion order in z this example is somewhat slow.
